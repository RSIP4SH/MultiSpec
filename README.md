# MultiSpec
# Description: MultiSpec is a freeware image data analysis application developed for interactively analyzing Earth observational multispectral and hyperspectral image data from airborne and spaceborne systems, as well as a number of other types of multispectral image data, such as medical images on MacOS and Windows platforms. There are currently in excess of several thousand known, registered users, from a wide range of sectors (research, higher ed, K-12, government, etc), who download and install the software package on their own computers. MultiSpec has also been integrated with the GABBs geospatial data solutions (termed MultiSpec Online) to provide users with a more seamless experience by using within a web browser. MultiSpec is programmed in C/C++; the wxWidgets library was used for the GUI interface to run in the linux environment on the HUBzero platform. The software uses several other libraries such as gdal, hdf4, hdf5, netcdf and OpenJPEG to handle the many different file formats for remote sensing image data.
